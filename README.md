# fantastic-project

## Introduction

Are you ready to explore new places and live new experiences? Fantastic-Project will **recommend** you exactly where you should visit next. Tell us your interests and we will tell you which event is ideal for you.

## Event Discovery

Use Fantastic-Project to **discover** new events in other cities. Fantastic-Project will consider your *interests* to suggest a location to you, but will also consider airline *ticket* prices and adequate *weather* conditions for an ideal trip. 
We want to use the information the API provides us such as country, category and labels to come up with a good suggestion to the user on what event should they go. 
The most important thing for now is to find the best way to link categories and labels to come up with the interest. 

## Short-term usability goals
Pull data from predictHQ 
ask for the user interest
display the events based on the interest of the user and the location of the user
use categories and labels to determine the interest of the user
